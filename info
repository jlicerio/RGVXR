To use this server:

1. First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer

2. Install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
node server.js
```

4. The server will display both local and network URLs. To test on mobile:
   - Make sure your mobile device is on the same WiFi network as your computer
   - Open the network URL displayed in the console on your mobile browser
   - Accept camera permissions when prompted

Important notes:
- For AR to work, you need to use HTTPS in production. For local testing, most browsers will allow HTTP on local network
- Make sure your mobile device supports WebXR/AR
- Some browsers might require you to enable flags for WebXR features

To test if everything is working:
1. Open the network URL on your mobile device
2. The AR experience should start automatically
3. You should see the red sphere in AR space
4. The GPS coordinates should update in the debug panel

Let me know if you need any adjustments to the server configuration!
