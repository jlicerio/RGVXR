 to my github

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you understand how to commit this project to GitHub. Here are the steps you'll need to follow:

1. First, initialize a new Git repository (if not already done):
```bash
git init
```

2. Add all the files to Git staging:
```bash
git add projects/ar-image-tracking/
```

3. Create your first commit:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: AR Image Tracking project with A-Frame and AR.js"
```

4. If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to github.com
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right
   - Select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "ar-image-tracking")
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license if you're pushing existing code

5. Connect your local repository to GitHub (replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY-NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
```

6. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Note: If your default branch is called "master" instead of "main", use:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

Additional tips:
- Make sure you have Git installed on your computer
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub in your terminal or have SSH keys set up
- If you get any authentication errors, you might need to:
  - Use a personal access token for HTTPS authentication
  - Or set up SSH keys for SSH authentication

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
