    "description": "For the Carrizo Comecrudo people of South Texas and Northeastern Mexico, animals hold a revered place as relatives and sources of strength. The bear, in particular, and the bear skin, carry symbolic weight, embodying strength, healing, and a profound connection to the natural world. Bear skins are worn by members of the tribe during a traditional Carrizo Comecrudo ceremony known as the Bear Dance. ",
