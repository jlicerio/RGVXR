They symbolize a connection to the earth and the cosmos, as well as pathways, journeys, and guidance. The Carrizo Comecrudo have specific meanings associated with each direction, including colors, animals, or spiritual beings. The poles depicted here are called Xie Kuaâ€™k Kuam and are used for various ceremonial purposes by the Carrizo. ",
