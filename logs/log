   - System handles different project structures appropriately

## Project Structure

### Final Organization:
- Root directory: Main application files
- /projects: Individual AR projects
- /debug: Testing and debugging tools

### Best Practices:
- Consistent naming conventions for assets
- Same library versions across projects
- Proper camera permission handling
- Loading screens for better user experience
- Iframe communication for resource management

## Future Improvements:
1. Add project metadata for better organization
2. Implement project categories or tags
3. Add user preferences for carousel behavior
4. Create template for new AR projects
5. Add analytics for project usage

## Development Template

This implementation serves as a template for future AR projects. To add new projects:

1. Create a new folder in the `projects` directory
2. Follow the structure of existing projects:
   ```
   projects/
   ├── [project-name]/
   │   ├── index.html
   │   └── assets/
   │       ├── asset.gltf or asset.glb (optional)
   │       └── marker.patt
   ```

3. The carousel will automatically detect and include the new project

### Project Types Supported:
- External 3D model-based projects (GLTF/GLB)
- A-Frame primitive-based projects (no external assets needed)
- Mixed projects combining both approaches

## 2024-03-XX - Initial Setup and Troubleshooting

### Working State:
- Individual projects work when accessed directly:
  - AR Object: /projects/ar object/index.html
  - AR Stakes: /projects/ar stakes/index.html

### Current Issues:

## WebXR Camera Passthrough Fix

### Issue:
The main application carousel was being overridden by WebXR test files, causing the index.html to display test links instead of the AR project carousel. Additionally, camera passthrough wasn't working properly in AR mode.

### Solution:
1. Fixed camera passthrough by:
   - Setting renderer to use alpha: true
   - Setting clear color alpha to 0
   - Using appropriate WebXR features (local-floor, camera-access)
   - Adding a camera-passthrough component to handle transparency

2. Separated test environment from main application:
   - Created dedicated debug server on port 8081
   - Kept main application server on port 8080
   - Moved all test files to debug directory
   - Added blocking middleware to prevent test files from being served by main server

3. Implemented proper project structure:
   - Created shared/webxr-components.js for reusable components
   - Updated AR project templates with proper camera configuration
   - Added documentation in docs/webxr-camera-solution.md

### How to Use:
1. Main Application: `npm start` (port 8080)
2. Debug Server: `npm run debug-server` (port 8081)
3. Both Servers: `npm run start-all`

### Technical Details:
The camera-passthrough component handles:
- Setting transparent background when scene loads
- Logging session info when entering AR mode
- Ensuring proper camera visibility in AR mode

See logs/fix-log.md and docs/webxr-camera-solution.md for complete documentation.

## Server Configuration Fix - 2024-03-XX

### Issue:
Server crashed due to duplicate variable declaration:
- Multiple declarations of `server` variable
- Duplicate SSL certificate configuration
- Redundant server initialization code

### Root Cause:
The server.js file had two separate server configurations:
1. Original configuration at the top with network interface detection
2. Duplicate configuration added during WebXR camera passthrough fix

### Solution:
1. Removed duplicate server configuration:
   - Removed redundant SSL certificate configuration
   - Removed duplicate server creation
   - Removed duplicate error handlers

2. Consolidated server configuration:
   - Kept original SSL configuration at top
   - Maintained single server instance
   - Preserved error handling and shutdown logic

3. Simplified server startup:
   ```javascript
   const sslOptions = {
       key: fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'cert', 'key.pem')),
       cert: fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'cert', 'cert.pem'))
   };

   const server = https.createServer(sslOptions, app);

   try {
       server.listen(port, () => {
           console.log(`Server running on https://localhost:${port}`);
       });
   } catch (err) {
       console.error('Failed to start server:', err);
       process.exit(1);
   }
   ```

### Status:
✅ Server running correctly
✅ HTTPS working properly
✅ Debug mode functioning
✅ All projects accessible

### Lessons Learned:
1. Keep server configuration in one place
2. Avoid duplicate variable declarations
3. Maintain clear separation between main and debug servers
4. Document server configuration changes
